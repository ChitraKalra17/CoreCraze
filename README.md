# 🏋️ CoreCraze – A Fitness Tracking Website

CoreCraze is a 5-page front-end fitness tracking website developed to demonstrate our hands-on experience with Git & GitHub for our Source Code Management course. While the website was previously built, this project focuses entirely on collaboration, version control workflows, and using GitHub efficiently as a team.

## 🔧 GitHub Workflow

This project used a structured feature-branch workflow with the following steps:

1. Initial repository setup and base code push.
2. Each member created and worked on their own feature branch.
3. Multiple commits with descriptive messages were made.
4. Pull requests (PRs) were created for each feature branch.
5. Code reviews and approvals before merging into main.
6. Merge conflict resolution where applicable.
7. GitHub Issues were used for task and bug tracking.
